# Maths_Problem_Classifier

This dataset comprises various mathematical problems, with each problem categorized into one of 24 distinct categories. 

The dataset is initially cleaned and processed by creating a bag-of-words model. The data is then divided into training and test sets. A Random Forest Classifier is employed to train the data, allowing for prediction of the results. Finally, the accuracy of the model is measured to evaluate its performance.
